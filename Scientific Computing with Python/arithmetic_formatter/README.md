Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. For example, "235 + 52" becomes:

  235
+  52
-----
Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.

Example
Function Call:

arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"])
Output:

   32      3801      45      123
+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49
-----    ------    ----    -----
Function Call:

arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 8", "1 - 3801", "9999 + 9999", "523 - 49"], True)
Output:

  32         1      9999      523
+  8    - 3801    + 9999    -  49
----    ------    ------    -----
