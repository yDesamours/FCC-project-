          <p id="quote">If we were to seize and eliminate from our industrial world the results of Mr. Tesla's work, the wheels of industry would stop, the trains would be immobilized, our cities would be thrown into darkness and our factories would be dead […] His name marks an era in the advancement of electrical science. From this work springs a revolution.</p>

      <p>We find some of its major innovations in our daily lives, in particular the electric motor. His sole purpose was that his findings serve the good of humanity, by wishing that every population of the world had free and open access to different energies such as electricity.</p>
      <p>He was the most prolific inventor ever known, with 900 patents filed, not to mention the many works he never patented and those that were usurped.</p>
     <h4>Here's a time line of Tesla's life:</h4>
     <ul >
       <li><strong>1856</strong> - Born in Serbia.</li>
       <li><strong>1875</strong> - He entered the Graz Polytechnic in Austria. The student impresses all his teachers because of his intellectual capacities which surpass that of all his fellow students - but also of his teachers.</li>
       <li><strong>1881</strong> - Due to lack of funds, he abandoned his studies for a civil servant job at the Hungarian Central Telegraph Office. Very quickly, he became chief engineer for Hungary's first telephone system.</li>
       <li><strong>1882</strong> - Tesla ends up in Paris to work for Thomas Edison's Continental Edison Company. It was in 1883 that he built the first AC induction motor. He also began work on rotating magnetic fields and its applications, for which he filed patents in 1886 and 1888.</li>
       <li><strong>1884</strong> - Nikola Tesla arrives in the United States alongside Edison, who has just created a DC power grid for all of New York City.</li>
       <li><strong>1886</strong> - He creates his own business.</li>
       <li><strong>1888</strong> - Georges Westinghouse buys Tesla's patents for $ 1 million, and hires the young man. He is in charge of developing an alternating current production system in competition with Thomas Edison’s direct current.</li>
       <li><strong>1890</strong> - He invented the Tesla coil. It is a high frequency alternating current transformer which greatly increases the voltage.</li>
       <li><strong>1893</strong> - Westinghouse Company has opportunity to install all US electricity infrastructure, promoting Tesla's leased AC power.</li>
       <li><strong>1896</strong> - Tesla is developing a hydroelectric system that converts power from Niagara Falls into electricity, powering thus the industries in the city of Buffalo.</li>
       <li><strong>1898</strong> - He built a radio-controlled boat. The automaton certainly too far ahead of its time did not capture the attention of many.</li>
       <li><strong>1899</strong> - He discovered terrestrial standing waves, which was for him his greatest discovery. He construct a transformer and illuminates 200 lamps, wirelessly, located 40 kilometers away!</li>
       <li><strong>1900</strong> - He began the construction of a tower 57 meters high.</li>
       <li><strong>1921</strong> - He patented a vertical lift-off propeller-driven aircraft, resembling today's helicopters.</li>
       <li><strong>1928</strong> - In 1928, he filed his last patent which included his flying device from 1921, to which he made improvements.</li>
       <li><strong>1943</strong> - Dies at the age of 87.</li> 
     </ul>
